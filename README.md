1. Implement NaÃ¯ve Bayes method using scikit-learn library Use dataset available with name glass Use train_test_split to create training and testing part Evaluate the model on test part using score and classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

2. Implement linear SVM method using scikit library Use the same dataset above Use train_test_split to create training and testing part Evaluate the model on test part using score and classification_report(y_true, y_pred)

3. Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why? => When compared to SVM, naive bayes produced better results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

The SVM couldn't give better results because the data has six classifiers and wasn't transported into the higher dimension.

SVM would have produced better results if the data transmission had occurred utilizing a kernel option.

In conclusion, naive bayes would be preferable if forced to select between it and ordinary SVM.
